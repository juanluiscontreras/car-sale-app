      "title": "The history of this car",
      "description1": "We are the second owners of this amazing car. After saving for a while, we decided to look for our first serious car, and what an adventure it was! We researched for months, asked everyone we knew, read forums... and although this car was a bit out of our budget, we were lucky to find it and that the previous owners were super nice!",
      "description2": "They were a family that took great care of it since they got it from the dealership. They kept up with all the maintenance, used it for trips and city driving, and sold it because they were going on a trip. We've continued that good care, using it for driving around Buenos Aires and escaping to the coast. We even did a pre-sale checkup that you can see!"

      "title": "Why are we selling it?",
      "description": "Honestly, it's a family matter. We had the opportunity to upgrade to a newer model. Although we love it, it's time to say goodbye and let someone else enjoy it."

      "title": "Why should you buy this car?",
      "description": "I've done the hard work for you: I checked out over 15 cars before deciding on this one. I went through everything, from poorly maintained cars to shady sellers. In the end, this car was by far the winner, and three different mechanics confirmed it: It's the best quality-price option! With proper maintenance, this car will last you many more kilometers."

    "doubts": {
      "title": "\"But, there are newer and cheaper cars in its range, why choose a Japanese car?\"",
      "description": "Yes, but here's the thing: the difference with other cars in its range from the Mercosur is HUGE. Even though this one has some years on it, it's still solid. It doesn't make strange noises, the materials are in excellent condition, and I've only taken it to the workshop for routine maintenance. And the best part, it has everything that other brands have cut out, and you don't need to do anything to enjoy it."
